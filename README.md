  * `Topology.java`
  * `StreamsBuilder.java`
* The outputs of the *diff metadata* provided by Intelligent History.
  * `diff-metadata-Topology.txt`
  * `diff-metadata-StreamsBuilder.txt`
* The set of commit history exploration graphs constructed for each participant in a Keynote.
  * `exploration-graphs.key`
* The session summaries to document the participant interviews from the study presented in the evaluation, also included in the thesis appendix.
  * `session-summaries.pdf`
