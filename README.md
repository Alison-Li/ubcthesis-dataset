# Dataset: Reducing the Cognitive and Temporal Costs of Software History Exploration

This repository acts as a public dataset to supplement the work presented in my master's thesis:

> Li, Alison. 2022. “Reducing the Cognitive and Temporal Costs of Software History Exploration.” Electronic Theses and Dissertations (ETDs) 2008+. T, University of British Columbia. doi:http://dx.doi.org/10.14288/1.0417465.


The dataset includes:
* A version of the two Java classes from Apache Kafka used throughout the thesis.
  * `Topology.java`
  * `StreamsBuilder.java`
* The outputs of the *diff metadata* provided by Intelligent History.
  * `diff-metadata-Topology.txt`
  * `diff-metadata-StreamsBuilder.txt`
* The set of commit history exploration graphs constructed for each participant in a Keynote.
  * `exploration-graphs.key`
* The session summaries to document the participant interviews from the study presented in the evaluation, also included in the thesis appendix.
  * `session-summaries.pdf`
