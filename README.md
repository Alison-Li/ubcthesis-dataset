# Dataset: Reducing the Cognitive and Temporal Costs of Software History Exploration

This repository acts as a public dataset to supplement the work presented in my master's thesis.
The dataset includes the outputs of the *diff metadata* provided by Intelligent History,
the set of commit history exploration graphs constructed for each participant in a Keynote,
and the session summaries to document the participant interviews from the study presented in the evaluation.
